# Week 4( Day 2)

## What are the three states of a Promise?

Promise is based on three states. Each state has a significance and can be used to drive a certain level of result as per the need. The three states of a promise are:

Pending: This is the initial state of a promise

Fulfilled: This is the state of a promise representing a successful operation

Rejected: This is the state of a promise representing a failed operation


## How do promises seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
 Promise allows to attach a callback function, instead of passing. The Promise code readability is easier than callback.

## What is the difference between .then() and .catch()?

Promise allows the action is either resolved or rejected. .then() is used for promise successfully resolved and .catch() is used for promises rejected.
