Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

I tried to populate the Vaults in the keepmodal and as keepmodal are also loading along with the card on the homepage. I had issues on my reactive, which is not relecting the keeps/views. I continued working on Vaultpage and display vault information. Had few UI issues, I continued working on the basic functionalities.

Had 1st evaluation and understood that the issues are all related to the UI and missed a functionality of deleting Keep in Vault display page.

I continued working on the UI related issues and had to bother TA's to under my mistakes and learned a lot on UI development.
