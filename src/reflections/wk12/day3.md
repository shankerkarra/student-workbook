# Week 12( Day 3)

## During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

I also initiated the front end to try for the Masonry, achieved the look, but while try to improve the look and made changes and was not able to revert back the look. Hence I decided to move for the boot strap look card so that I can continue my application developement. Even though I have the code, I couldn't revert back to masonary look. I also had an issue in the KeepModal for fixed alignment and responsive look.
