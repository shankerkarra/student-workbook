Oberserver pattern allows one-to-many data bindings between elements, which can be event driven. This pattern allows to build reusable code.

## What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

The three mechanism of the observer pattern are  The subscriber method, the unsubscriber method, and the broadcast method.


## Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

The update of the dom is based on the change of events happening on the proxystate, when an of change on th array of objects, it does reflect the dom, without refreshing the complete Url.
