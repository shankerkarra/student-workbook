# Week 9( Day 3)

## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?
In Scrum with Smaller team, the permutation and combinations of inter-communication between team members is less when compared to the Larger team. By reducing the coordination in smaller teams, the decision making is faster, where as in larger teams too much coordination and generate too much complexity for an empirical process, does create conflicts in team.

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.

Scrum is a timeboxed events and every event has a maximum duration.Suggested Scrum team size is 7, plus or minus two members and Scrum suggest to run a single sprint at a time, which helps in completing small chunks of the projects,  to evaluate the team output / progress and also have the flexibility to change the scope based on the market requirements.


## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?

Adjusting the tradeoff for a good software varies between the speed to develop vs. the quality of the software delivered is reffered as the "Unattainable triangle". 

Since Scrum team concentrates in group decision, the team need to be focused and decide if they can complete the developement process(can any one of the team member take the slack)  without impacting the quality. In case if the team decides, that is not possible, the task has to be shifted back to the product backlog for future Sprints.
