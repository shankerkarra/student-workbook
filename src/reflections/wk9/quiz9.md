**1.** What is Inheritance?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
In Object Oriented Programming system(OOPs), inheritance is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. 

Using inheritance, we can create new classes that are built upon existing classes, where we can reuse methods and fields of the parent class and also can add new methods and fields in your current class. Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

```
**5.** What is the `Factory` design pattern?

```
**6.** What is test driven development?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
**7.** In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
**10.** In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
