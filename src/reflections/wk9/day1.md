# Week 9( Day 1)

## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

In our group project, technologies we are using Vue, MongoDB and scrum methodologies with in the team along with peer programming.

## What went well so far?

Tema co-ordination and peer programming.

## What would you do differently? Why?

I joined the group after 2 days and I would have suggested team members to work on independently and later on do a code review. So that team members can learn how to do individually and also will be able to learn the thought process of problem solving from their team members.
