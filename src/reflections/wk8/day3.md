## What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

The benefits of testing in the software development, reduces the edge cases issues which might be in rare case scenario. In this process of testing, the development team are confident that the code is perfect.


## What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

The major drawback in software development testing is updating the testing scripts along with software changes. As mostly the update team members are either not aware that there is a unit testing or confident that their changes are not need to test.

The other major issues is to too tightly coupled software modules when changes a change an impact a triggering process of issues, because of coupling. Instead the software developement should be broeke in to multiple of class / modules.
