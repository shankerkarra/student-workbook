# Week 8( Day 4)

## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

The three main types of testing, are 
1) Unit Testing
2) Component Testing
3) End-to-End Testing


Unit Testing allows to test modules and classes.

Component testing allows developer to test the full functionality of the component, also intergration with other components.

End-to-end testing allows developer to test the whole application, so that they can forsee the upcoming issues, which can be fixed before releasing the software.

## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

All testing methods have pros and cons, unit testing is the most important as the issues can be fixed at the beginining itself, so that it doesn't trickle down into a major issue; where debugging and fixing cost will be higher and loose of confidence on the product.
 But still software prior to release QA team should be  following other testing such as Integration, System, Regression, Acceptance.

## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

 I don't think there is any testing method that is the least useful, as at every level of testing the scope changes and it helps in providing confidence of the team/software.

 Static testing, as it only examines the source code against the accompanying documentation, as their is not execution of the program.
