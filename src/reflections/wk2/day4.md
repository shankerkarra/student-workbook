## What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Designing a plan like Wireframe / Psuedocode helps the developer to show, what is his/her understanding of the requirements. Also it hels the management to view how the application and flow will looks like.

## How do you find answers when you are stuck?

When, I am stuck, I make a notes of all activies which are completed and yet to be done. Followed by read through the related articles / understand and play around with code. Once my understanding is clear, I will see where it can be applied to my project.

## From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

Initiate the coding only when you understood the small section and slowly refactor the code accordingly to the enhancements. Test the code as per the written functionality and then include the functionality for edge cases, so that the application doesn't crash.
