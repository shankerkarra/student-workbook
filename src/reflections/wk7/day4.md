# Week 7( Day 3)

## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

Partial notes writing in the code, for missing / uncompleted. While pair programming, I was able to learn and understand the thought process of my partner( Jo-Nathan w). I am still learning to design a good UI.
 
## What went well?

Tema co-ordination went well, as we both discussed the complete flow and how to implement.

## What would you do differently?

I would concentrated more on the UX, as it is my weakness and I am learning to improve.
