As VUE.js's Single Page Applications(SPA) are becoming more complex, we need to use vue Router, nested routes. Nested routes allow for more complex UI with components nested.

## When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

Nested Route cna use used for drill down to show independent components in the Navigation bar.(for example: HR at Top leve in Nagivation bar and Career / Benefits / New employee boarding / ... are all individula components, which are nested under HR)

## Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

Yes - parameter can be through nested routes.
Based on the above answer, login users are eligible to access somes of the components under HR, non-login users might be eligible for viewing some of the components.
