# Week 11( Day 2)

## Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I enjoyed attending this program and learned a lot from my Instructors(Mark/Jake/Zack/Brittany) and also from the knowledge of the TA ( Harrison/Mick/Jonsey/curtis). I will try to practice and see to develop application to the volunteer Organization, while searching for a job. I enjoyed learning creating User Interface( which I used to hate).
